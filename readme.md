# Mutavive

A cellular automaton featuring structural variants in cells.

## Development path

- [x] create the grid of cells.
- [x] Colour every mutation with a random colour.
- [x] Mutation probability sample from a distribution.
- [ ] Local natural selection.
- [ ] Differing strength of natural selection.
- [ ] Colors as a function of the total state of the genome.
- [ ] Pause functionality.
- [ ] Show generation as a label somewhere.
- [ ] Mutation on a 'x' number of bases chosen at random.
    - [ ] Model cell data as n bases rather than genomic regions.
